/*
 Line by line  : Interpreter
 Whole program : Compiler
 Partial execution till the error(means will execute till error and stop at error) : Interpreter
 No execution if error(will not compile code at all) : Compiler
 Compiled is faster than interpreted but difficult to use than the interpreted
 Machine Code  : The code running on platform means windows , linux, macOS

 Java hybrid language = interpreter + compiled
 Java platform independent means write java file compile it into class file which has byte code
 , anyone can use it at any platform means windows ,linux , macOS

               Compiled
 Java file     ------->     Class File    ------->    Can be interpreted by java interpreter
